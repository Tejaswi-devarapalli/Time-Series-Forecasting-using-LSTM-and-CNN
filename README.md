**ABOUT PROJECT**
<br />

Time series forecasting is an important area of AI. It is important because there are so many prediction problems that involve a time component. This time component makes time series problems more difficult to handle. In this project,I applied LSTM and CNN models to 'TISELAC' classification dataset. Then, I have applied LSTM and CNN models to 'Covid3Month' regression dataset. In addition, I have also implemented additional features such as building model with bidirectional LSTM followed by Attention layers.

Two datasets were used in this project:

**Classifiation:** 'Tiselac' dataset. It is Time Series Land Cover Classification problem with Train Size '81714', Test size '17973', Length '23', No of Dimension '10' and 9 classes. Using 'Aeon' library it can be directly loaded the splitted train and test data. 
**Regression :** 'Covid3Month' dataset. The dataset contains 201 timeseries, that contains daily covid confirmed cases for each country for 3 months to predict the death rate after those three months.
